The player controls a basket that moves left and right to collect falling objects while avoiding missing them. The game dynamically spawns fruits that fall at increasing speeds, testing both reflexes and precision. Power-ups occasionally drop from the sky, adding unique twists — such as freezing time, slowing down object speed, or granting bonus points. Every catch boosts your score, while each miss inches you closer to the end of the round.

The project features a clean modular structure that separates logic into multiple components:
	•	player.py manages movement, drawing, and collision.
	•	object.py handles random spawning and gravity simulation for the falling items.
	•	powerup.py introduces temporary effects and gameplay variety.
	•	game_manager.py controls the overall state, scoring, and timer system.
	•	Menus like main_menu.py, pause_menu.py, and game_over.py provide a full game loop experience.
